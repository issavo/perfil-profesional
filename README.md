# Portfolio

Thriflora is a registration form to collect emails from potential customers who want to be the first to test the online shop. At the moment it is only shown in Spain, Italy and France.

## Content

This project has one branch: master contains the repositorie of my curriculum as developer.

## How to clone

- We can get the code from a repository by downloading a simple Zip. From the download button.
- We can also clone the repository from a url:
    - First you will copy the URL of the remote repository you want to clone (from the "clone" button). You have two options, with https.
    - Second you will open a terminal window, to place yourself over the folder of your project that you want to clone.
    - Third a folder with the name of the project you are cloning, or any other name you think is better for this repository.
    - Fourth you place yourself inside that folder (cd, cd...) and from there you launch the command to make the clone:
         git clone https://gitlab.com/sonia-orive/thriflora.git


## About the portfolio
